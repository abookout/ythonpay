# Ythonpay

Ythonpay (pronounced "eye-thon-pay") is simply Python, except all of the keywords are in [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin).

This project was made in a few hours as a joke. It is, however, technically a fully-featured programming language. If anyone ever writes anything with it, please let know. I'd love to see it!

Before you leave, if nothing else, have a look at `examples/odecay.ypay` to get just a taste of the great potential of Ythonpay.

## Getting Started

You can use Ythonpay as you would Python: either start the REPL using `python3 ythonpay.py`, or execute a file such as with `python3 ythonpay.py examples/odecay.ypay`
